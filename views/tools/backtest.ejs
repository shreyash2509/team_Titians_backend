            <p>
                Portfolio backtesting is the process of simulating an investment strategy using historical prices to test how well the strategy would have done in the past. Running a simulation over a large number of stocks for past decades is a computationally intensive process. But if you are testing and building models with standard datasets, you are using inaccurate data that may render the results of those tests less reliable - jeopardizing your entire process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Look ahead bias occurs when research or a simulation relies on data or information that was not yet available or known during the time period being studied. You may be applying lag assumptions to mitigate these risks - however these lags are also imprecise. Complicated by filings regulations that change over time and differ between countries and companies, they are often an ineffective solution to the problem.   </p>
